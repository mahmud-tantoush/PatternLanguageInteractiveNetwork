**Author:** Mahmud Tantoush

## Description
This is an **interactive visualization** of *A Pattern Language*.  
It helps users explore and understand the **nested layers** of the language — from patterns of buildings and streets to patterns of cities and regions.  

The tool can be used both as a **teaching aid** and an **analytical framework** to compare urban forms and spatial relationships across cities.
